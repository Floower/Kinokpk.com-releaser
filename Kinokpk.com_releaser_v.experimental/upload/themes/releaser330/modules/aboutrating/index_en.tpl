From September of 2009, torrentsbook.com uses revolutionary rating system, which described below:<br/><br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h1>The main rule: Seed the same releases or more, than you have downloaded (IN COUNT <span
                style="color: #ff0000;">OF TORRENTS, NOT A GIGABYTES!</span>)</h1>
    </li>
    <li>If you registered less than 7 days ago, text described below is a manual for you, and rating system does not
        decrease your rating.
    </li>
    <li>Our rating system based on single user ratings given by another users, and, also, on seeding, but not on seeding
        speed (of course we know, that there are cheaters, but we hope that you are honest user).
    </li>
    <li>Okay, rating system based on rating (carma) of a single user, lets look what it depends on:</li>
    <li>1. On user marks, given by another users to user, his comments, etc. (e.g. when you increase rating for single
        comment, you increase rating to this author too)
    </li>
    <li>2. On releases count and a fact of seeding (e.g. if you downloaded 6 releases and are seeding 6 releases, you
        will be promoted. If you downloaded 6 releases and are seeding 12, you will be promoted twice times. Total
        promoting formula: 1*(count of seeding releases+discount)/count of downloaded releases. If you leached more
        releases than you are seeding, your rating will be decreased).
    </li>
    <li>3. For downloading of .torrent file you rating will be decreased by 1 once. You can download .torrent again
        without rating decrease.
    </li>
    <li>4. If you have -10 rating, you can not download releases.</li>
    <li>5. If you have -200 rating your account will be disabled.</li>
    <li>6. For uploading release we grant you +5 ratings.</li>
    <li>7. To get "discount" (e.g. seed less releases than you downloaded) you can exchange your rating or pay). For
        example, you downloaded 6 releases and are seeding 3, and have 3 points of discount, so you will get +1 rating
        in 3 hours (Formula is 1*(3+3/6)=1).
    </li>
    <li><strong>8. Users having VIP class does not affected by rating system.</strong></li>
    <li>9. From 04.09.09 your rating can not be automatically increased more than 300 points (this restriction does not
        affects ratings given by another users, release uploading, etc).
    </li>
    <li>10. From 25.09.09 we do not count releases, uploaded by user to his uploads.</li>
    <li>11. From 01.01.10 rating system only works when user is connected to the tracker.</li>
    <li>12. From 04.01.10 we give you +5 ratings for release uploading and +5 ratings for user invation, and also +10
        ratings to filling the request.
    </li>
    <li>13. From 24.01.10 amout of discount can not be more than count of uploaded releases (golden, yours and your
        present releases does not counted)
    </li>
</ul>
